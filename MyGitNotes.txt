######################### local machine #################################33
git init # creates git repository on local machine ( in whatever folder you are working in)
		 # stores a .git file with all versions of files in it (changelog etc)
		 # if intent is to sync with github repository, don't use this step; initiate 
		 # repository on github, and [git clone] repository


git status  # gets status of repository what branch you are on, and what files are being tracked


git add FILENAME.EXT # adds file to git repository (or updates if file is already there)
git add .            # add all file updates to repository (do add before commit)
git add *html 		 # add all files ending with 'html' 


git commit  		  # commit all changes to repository (.git stuff)
					  # will need to add a message of changes here
git commit -m 'MESSAGE' # allows to put message inline instead of opening a text editor

git log # prints out changes to the repository


# bonus
.gitignore # if you create this file, put things like *.txt for git to ignore any file ending txt

###################### branching ##############################

# basic protocol is to checkout to a "newBranch" (from "master" branch), 
# do changes to the files, git add, git commit
# then git checkout master, git merge 

git checkout -b (branch name) # checks out to new branch (branch name)

git merge "newbranch" # do when done editing "newbranch" and have checkout out "master" branch

git branch # tells what branch we are on

################################################################

git stash # holds changes on separate branch


git diff # shows differences b/t two directories


################## remote repositories ######################### 


git remote # list remote repository (origin = from, upstream = to)
git remote -v # list urls for remote repository

git clone (url) #copies repository with from web to personal computer

git fetch origin #bring any changes made on remote repository into personal directory
# git history (will not change local files, run [git merge] to do that)

git pull origin # fetches and merges in one step


git push origin master #when local changes are ready to be pushed to remote [origin] repository.
 # be sure that local changes have been git commited first.. 


git remote add <reponame> <url> # adds new repo to current directory (advanced, 2 repositories)
